In homework:
My Atoi
(Task1 Very well built solution
Nice comments. Good implemetation
Note! When casting and unexpected result is expected, I suggest to use Try-Catch blocks ( will teach in future )


Convert Integer to Romain number
(Task2 Well built solutionCould be improved by adding some handling in loops and structred data structures ( e.g. Arraylists ), as in the future we could have numbers larger than 3999 ( millions, billions? )
Complexity can be reduced))

at the lesson :
third maximum- (Given an integer array nums, return the third distinct maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.)
